A standard todo list. Makes use of todos as objects that are dynamically created using factory functions/constructors/classes. The user will be able to create todo items and put them into a "projects" list. Users can create new projects and choose which created todo items go into. A basic UI to view all projects, view todos in each project, expand a todo item to see/edit details, and delete a todo item.

## Getting Started

In order to setup and work on this project on your own, you will need to:

1. Clone this project:  
`git clone https://github.com/bykimus-prime/TOP-todo-list.git`

2. Once you have cloned this project, you need to install npm and webpack. The required dependencies are:  
`npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`. This will create the needed node_modules file in your project directory.

3. The package.json should be configured so that distribution files can be produced using:  
`npm run build` or your preferred method.

4. I used date-fns for date manipulation in javascript and other handy functions. For webpack:
`npm install date-fns --save`
